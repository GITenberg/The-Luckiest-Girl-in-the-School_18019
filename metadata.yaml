  Woodward helplessly, with her house-keeping book in one hand, and her bank pass-book
  in the other, and an array of bills spread out on the table in front of her. "Children,

  realize it the better. I wish I knew where to begin." "Might knock off going to
  church, and save the money we give in collections!" suggested Percy flippantly.

  once! You and Winona are quite old enough to understand business matters. I must
  discuss them with somebody. As I said before, we shall really have to economize
